# AI Website Builder with CrewAI

Hi, we have a brand new project to work on, and we have a fresh start here.

I would like to use [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction) to build a website generator with a team of 3 agent types, a Product Manager, a UI/UX Designer, and a Software Engineer.

I would like to use [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples) with CrewAI to expand the capabilities of the LLM.

For the LLM we will be using Anthropic.

I would like an .env file to put our Anthropic key.

Let's start by setting up the [Poetry environment for Python](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/).

To start working on the project, I would like this to use Python for working with CrewAI.

But I think it would be worth creating a React Frontend with Tailwind to handle choosing what to build, and then showing what our crew builds over time.

I would like our Crew to build React apps, styled with Tailwind and ShadCN for our UI. We will not be building backends with our CrewAI team yet, but we may in the future.

Let's start creating a plan for this, and once we figure out what we want to build, then we can start to build.
