# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Phase

**Phase 2: Post-Processing Pipeline Fixes**

The AI Website Generator is fully functional with all three agents working correctly. However, we've identified critical issues in the post-processing pipeline that prevent proper file extraction and status tracking. The core AI collaboration is working perfectly - we need to fix the technical infrastructure that processes the agent outputs.

## Recent Activities

### Completed

1. **Project Requirements Analysis**: Analyzed user requirements for AI Website Builder with CrewAI
2. **Technology Research**: Fetched and documented key information about:
   - CrewAI framework capabilities and architecture
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and their capabilities
   - Poetry for Python dependency management
3. **Sequential Planning**: Used sequential thinking to develop comprehensive project architecture
4. **Memory Bank Creation**: Established core documentation files:
   - `projectbrief.md` - Core project definition and requirements
   - `productContext.md` - User experience goals and value propositions
   - `systemPatterns.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
   - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development environment
5. **ShadCN Integration**: Added ShadCN/UI to frontend technology stack:
   - Updated all relevant documentation files
   - Added comprehensive ShadCN/UI documentation
   - Updated component generation patterns for AI agents

### Currently Working On

- âœ… Complete AI Website Generator implemented and functional
- âœ… All three CrewAI agents working correctly (Product Manager, UI Designer, Software Engineer)
- âœ… Frontend and backend fully operational
- âœ… Successful end-to-end test completed with website generation
- ðŸ”§ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**:
  - Status endpoint returning 500 Internal Server Error
  - Incomplete code generation (truncated output)
  - Missing file parsing and extraction pipeline

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Fix Status Endpoint (Priority 1)

- [ ] Debug the 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/v1/projects/{id}/status`
- [ ] Examine backend code to understand status parsing logic
- [ ] Fix project status determination from crew output
- [ ] Test status endpoint with generated project data

### 2. Fix Code Generation Completeness (Priority 2)

- [ ] Investigate why Software Engineer output is truncated
- [ ] Check for token limits or output parsing issues
- [ ] Ensure complete React application generation
- [ ] Verify all components are fully generated

### 3. Implement File Parsing Pipeline (Priority 3)

- [ ] Parse crew output to extract individual files
- [ ] Create proper file structure (App.tsx, components/, package.json)
- [ ] Save files in organized project directory
- [ ] Enable file download and preview functionality

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Multi-Agent Approach**: Three specialized agents (Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, Software Engineer)
2. **Technology Stack**: Python/CrewAI backend, React/Tailwind/ShadCN frontend
3. **MCP Integration**: Use filesystem, memory, fetch, and sequential thinking servers
4. **API Design**: RESTful API with FastAPI for backend communication
5. **UI Components**: ShadCN/UI for modern, AI-ready component generation

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phased Development**: 7-phase implementation approach
2. **Memory-First Approach**: Comprehensive documentation before coding
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Support for user feedback and project iteration

## Current Focus Areas

### Technical Architecture

- Finalizing agent collaboration patterns
- Defining MCP server integration approach
- Planning file generation and project structure

### User Experience

- Designing intuitive project specification interface
- Planning real-time preview and feedback system
- Defining project export and download workflow

## Key Decisions Finalized

### Product Decisions âœ… CONFIRMED

1. **Application Complexity**: Simple React applications (landing pages, portfolios, basic forms)
2. **User Input Method**: Natural language only - users describe requirements in plain English
3. **Component Priority**:
   - Phase 1: Forms (Input, Button, Card, Label)
   - Phase 2: Layout (Container, Grid, Navigation)
   - Phase 3: Data Display (Table, Badge, Avatar)
   - Phase 4: Advanced (Dialog, Toast, Complex interactions)
4. **State Management**: React built-ins only (useState, useContext, useReducer)

### Technical Decisions âœ… CONFIRMED

1. **Database**: JSON files for MVP (simple file-based storage)
2. **File Storage**: Local filesystem for generated projects
3. **Deployment Strategy**: Local development focus for MVP

## Context for Next Session

When resuming work, the next developer should:

1. **Read All Memory Bank Files**: Essential for understanding project scope and current status
2. **Review Test Results**: Examine the successful crew execution and identified issues
3. **Focus on Critical Fixes**: Address the three priority issues preventing full functionality
4. **Test Systematically**: Verify each fix with end-to-end testing

## Test Results Summary

### âœ… What Works Perfectly

- All three CrewAI agents execute successfully
- Product Manager creates comprehensive specifications
- UI Designer provides detailed design guidelines
- Software Engineer generates React code with TypeScript and Tailwind
- Frontend and backend communication is functional
- Crew execution completes without errors

### ðŸ”´ What Needs Fixing

- Status endpoint crashes with 500 errors
- Generated code is incomplete (truncated)
- No file parsing/extraction pipeline
- Frontend cannot display completion status or files

## Important Notes

- **Memory Bank is Foundation**: All implementation should reference these documented patterns and decisions
- **User-Centric Approach**: Keep user experience goals central to all technical decisions
- **Extensible Design**: Architecture should support future enhancements and additional agents
- **Quality Focus**: Generated code must be production-ready and follow best practices
