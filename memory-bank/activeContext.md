# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Phase

**Phase 0: Memory Bank Establishment and Planning**

We are currently in the initial setup phase, establishing our memory bank documentation and preparing for implementation. This phase involves documenting our comprehensive plan and research findings before beginning actual development.

## Recent Activities

### Completed

1. **Project Requirements Analysis**: Analyzed user requirements for AI Website Builder with CrewAI
2. **Technology Research**: Fetched and documented key information about:
   - CrewAI framework capabilities and architecture
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and their capabilities
   - Poetry for Python dependency management
3. **Sequential Planning**: Used sequential thinking to develop comprehensive project architecture
4. **Memory Bank Creation**: Established core documentation files:
   - `projectbrief.md` - Core project definition and requirements
   - `productContext.md` - User experience goals and value propositions
   - `systemPatterns.md` - Technical architecture and design patterns
   - `techContext.md` - Technology stack and development environment
5. **ShadCN Integration**: Added ShadCN/UI to frontend technology stack:
   - Updated all relevant documentation files
   - Added comprehensive ShadCN/UI documentation
   - Updated component generation patterns for AI agents

### Currently Working On

- âœ… Memory bank establishment completed
- âœ… Official technology documentation saved
- ðŸ”„ Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Complete Memory Bank Setup

- [x] Create `progress.md` to track implementation phases
- [x] Create `official-documentation/` folder structure
- [x] Document CrewAI official documentation
- [x] Document MCP servers documentation
- [x] Document Poetry usage patterns

### 2. Prepare for Implementation

- [x] Review and validate all memory bank documentation
- [x] Confirm project structure and approach
- [x] Prepare for Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Multi-Agent Approach**: Three specialized agents (Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, Software Engineer)
2. **Technology Stack**: Python/CrewAI backend, React/Tailwind/ShadCN frontend
3. **MCP Integration**: Use filesystem, memory, fetch, and sequential thinking servers
4. **API Design**: RESTful API with FastAPI for backend communication
5. **UI Components**: ShadCN/UI for modern, AI-ready component generation

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phased Development**: 7-phase implementation approach
2. **Memory-First Approach**: Comprehensive documentation before coding
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Support for user feedback and project iteration

## Current Focus Areas

### Technical Architecture

- Finalizing agent collaboration patterns
- Defining MCP server integration approach
- Planning file generation and project structure

### User Experience

- Designing intuitive project specification interface
- Planning real-time preview and feedback system
- Defining project export and download workflow

## Pending Questions/Decisions

### To Clarify with User

1. **Complexity Level**: What types of React applications should the system generate?
2. **User Input Method**: Natural language, structured forms, or both?
3. **Component Scope**: Focus on specific component types initially?
4. **State Management**: Preferences for React state management approach?

### Technical Considerations

1. **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL for production vs. simpler alternatives for MVP
2. **Deployment Strategy**: Docker containers vs. serverless approach
3. **File Storage**: Local filesystem vs. cloud storage for generated projects

## Context for Next Session

When resuming work, the next developer should:

1. **Read All Memory Bank Files**: Essential for understanding project scope and decisions
2. **Review Technology Research**: Understand CrewAI, MCP, and Poetry capabilities
3. **Validate Architecture**: Ensure the planned approach aligns with requirements
4. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with Poetry environment setup and basic project structure

## Important Notes

- **Memory Bank is Foundation**: All implementation should reference these documented patterns and decisions
- **User-Centric Approach**: Keep user experience goals central to all technical decisions
- **Extensible Design**: Architecture should support future enhancements and additional agents
- **Quality Focus**: Generated code must be production-ready and follow best practices

## Communication Protocol

### With User

- Provide clear progress updates
- Ask for clarification on pending questions
- Demonstrate working features as they're completed

### Between Sessions

- Update this file with current status
- Document any new decisions or changes
- Maintain clear next steps for continuity
