## Overall Project Status

### Current Status

- **Phase**: 0 (Memory Bank Establishment) - COMPLETED
- **Next Phase**: 1 (Foundation Setup)
- **Overall Completion**: ~14% (1 of 7 phases complete)

### Key Metrics

- **Documentation**: 100% complete for planning phase
- **Architecture**: Fully designed and documented
- **Technology Research**: Complete
- **Implementation**: 0% (ready to begin)

### Risks and Mitigation

1. **CrewAI Learning Curve**: Mitigated by thorough documentation research
2. **MCP Server Complexity**: Mitigated by starting with basic servers
3. **Agent Collaboration**: Mitigated by incremental testing approach
4. **User Experience**: Mitigated by user-centric design principles

### Next Session Priorities

1. Begin Phase 1: Foundation Setup
2. Initialize Poetry environment
3. Set up basic project structure
4. Configure development environment
5. Install and test core dependencies

## Notes for Future Sessions

### Important Reminders

- Always read all memory bank files before starting work
- Update this progress file after each session
- Test each phase thoroughly before moving to the next
- Keep user experience goals central to all decisions
- Document any architectural changes or new patterns

### Success Indicators

- Each phase should have working, demonstrable features
- Code quality should meet production standards
- User feedback should be incorporated iteratively
- System should be extensible for future enhancements
