## 🚧 **Current Phase: Phase 6 - React Router Preview Integration**

### **Status**: 🟡 **READY TO IMPLEMENT** - Planning Complete

### **Current Issue** ❌

- ❌ **External Preview Problem**: Preview buttons open external servers (localhost:3001, 3002, 3003)
- ❌ **Context Loss**: Users leave the main application when previewing
- ❌ **Poor UX**: New browser tabs/windows break the user flow
- ❌ **Navigation Issues**: No easy way back to gallery

### **Phase 6 Solution** 🎯

**Replace external preview servers with seamless in-app project previews using React Router**

#### **Target User Experience**:

```
Current: Gallery → Click Preview → New Tab (localhost:3003) → Lost Context
Target:  Gallery → Click Preview → /preview/project-id → Back to Gallery
```

#### **Phase 6.1: Router Foundation** (Day 1)

- [ ] **Install React Router**: Add react-router-dom dependencies
- [ ] **Router Setup**: Update main.tsx with BrowserRouter
- [ ] **Route Structure**: Refactor App.tsx to use Routes
- [ ] **Navigation Update**: Update gallery preview buttons

#### **Phase 6.2: Preview Component** (Day 1-2)

- [ ] **ProjectPreview Component**: New full-screen preview component
- [ ] **Backend API Enhancement**: Preview content and asset serving endpoints
- [ ] **Iframe Rendering**: Serve project content through dedicated API
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test with existing projects

#### **Phase 6.3: Navigation & Polish** (Day 2-3)

- [ ] **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Gallery > Project Preview
- [ ] **Back Button Functionality**: Return to gallery with context
- [ ] **Action Toolbar**: Download, share, settings from preview
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Mobile-responsive preview layout
