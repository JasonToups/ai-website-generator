# Product Context - AI Website Builder

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement

Creating modern React applications requires significant technical expertise, time, and coordination between different roles (product management, design, and engineering). Many users have great ideas for web applications but lack the technical skills or resources to bring them to life efficiently.

### Solution Vision

An AI-powered website builder that democratizes React application development by providing an intelligent team of AI agents that can collaborate just like human teams, but with the speed and consistency of automation.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- **Entrepreneurs and Startups**: Need to quickly prototype and build MVPs
- **Small Business Owners**: Want professional web presence without hiring developers
- **Designers**: Need to create functional prototypes from their designs
- **Non-technical Product Managers**: Want to create demos and proof-of-concepts

### Secondary Users

- **Developers**: Looking for rapid prototyping and boilerplate generation
- **Agencies**: Need to accelerate client project delivery
- **Educators**: Teaching web development concepts

## User Experience Goals

### Core User Journey

1. **Input**: User describes their vision in natural language or structured requirements
2. **Collaboration**: AI agents work together to analyze, design, and implement
3. **Generation**: Complete React project with components, styling, and structure
4. **Preview**: User can see and interact with the generated application
5. **Iteration**: User can request changes and refinements
6. **Export**: Download ready-to-run React project

### Key Experience Principles

- **Simplicity**: No technical knowledge required to get started
- **Transparency**: Users can see what each agent is doing and why
- **Control**: Users maintain oversight and can guide the process
- **Quality**: Generated code should be production-ready and follow best practices
- **Speed**: Faster than traditional development cycles
- **Learning**: Users should understand what was built and how
