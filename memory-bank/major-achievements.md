## 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH SUCCESS: Claude 3.5 Sonnet Upgrade

**Date**: January 28, 2025  
**Status**: PRODUCTION READY ✅

## 🚀 What We Accomplished

### Critical Issues RESOLVED

1. **Status Endpoint Fixed** ✅

   - **Problem**: 500 Internal Server Error in `/api/v1/projects/{id}/status`
   - **Root Cause**: Field mapping issue (`id` vs `project_id`)
   - **Solution**: Added proper field mapping in API route
   - **Result**: Status endpoint now returns 200 OK with accurate data

2. **Code Generation Completeness Fixed** ✅

   - **Problem**: Software Engineer agent output truncated mid-component
   - **Root Cause**: Token limit exceeded (4096 tokens insufficient)
   - **Solution**: Upgraded to Claude 3.5 Sonnet with 8192 token limit
   - **Result**: Complete, production-ready websites now generated

3. **Agent Performance Dramatically Improved** ✅
   - **Upgrade**: All three agents to `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`
   - **Enhancement**: Doubled token limits (4096 → 8192)
   - **Impact**: Professional-grade code generation without truncation
